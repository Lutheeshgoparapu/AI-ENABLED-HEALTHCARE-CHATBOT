# AI-ENABLED-HEALTHCARE-CHATBOT
## AIM:
To create a AI ENABLED HEALTHCARE CHATBOT using python.
## ABSTRACT:
Machines are becoming capable of performing tasks like humans in this age of Artificial Intelligence. The most vital aspect of living a healthy life is health care, and the most difficult aspect is finding a doctor's consultant. Everyone cannot afford to visit a doctor for every health issue. The objective of the proposed research work is to design or build a Healthcare chat bot in AI to assist in determining the patient's health and providing basic information before contacting a doctor, but only for minor issues. Using a medical chat bot will save healthcare costs while also increasing medical knowledge. 


Our python-based system connects patients with the chatbot that will help them give the correct answers and precautions to their questions. It is developed with the aim to provide helpful information instantly, especially in times when every second is important. The system will also help the users find doctors, clinics, and hospitals nearby their location in emergencies. Healthcare chatbots are AI-powered virtual assistants that provide personalized support to patients and healthcare providers. They are designed to simulate human-like conversation, enabling patients to interact with them as they would with a real person. Chatbots can be used in various healthcare settings, such as hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, to provide medical information, schedule appointments.The objective of the proposed research work is to design or build a Healthcare chat bot in AI to assist in determining the patient's health and providing basic information before contacting a doctor, but only for minor issues.

## INTRODUCTION:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation have rapidly become popular in many industries, including healthcare. One of the most fascinating applications of AI and automation in healthcare is using chatbots. Chatbots in healthcare are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, providing personalized assistance and support. Healthcare chatbots are AI-powered virtual assistants that provide personalized support to patients and healthcare providers. 

They are designed to simulate human-like conversation, enabling patients to interact with them as they would with a real person. These chatbots are trained on healthcare-related data and can respond to many patient inquiries, including appointment scheduling, prescription refills, and symptom checking.
 
AI chatbots are used in healthcare to provide patients with a more personalized experience while reducing the workload of healthcare professionals. The objective of the proposed research work is to design or build a Healthcare chat bot in AI to assist in determining the patient's health and providing basic information before contacting a doctor, but only for minor issues. Using a medical chat bot will save healthcare costs while also increasing medical knowledge. It is developed with the aim to provide helpful information instantly, especially in times when every second is important. 
## PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Today in the present era, the major challenges that India as a country is facing are to cater good quality and affordable healthcare services to its growing population and at the same time, they are not cost-efficient. This inaccessibility of healthcare facilities especially in rural areas and the difficulty in accessing means of transport causes patients to postpone their treatment, or option for medical facilities which is closer but at the same time are not cost-efficient and well-matched to their medical needs.

To tackle the above-mentioned problem, we have introduced an AI Healthcare Bot system. Our python-based system connects patients with the chatbot that will help them give the correct answers and precautions to their questions. It is developed with the aim to provide helpful information instantly, especially in times when every second is important. The system will also help the users find doctors, clinics, and hospitals nearby their location in emergencies. 

The main intention behind developing the application is to provide healthcare services in dispersed areas of  India and  identify the  gaps  emerging  in  implementing  cloud computing in the healthcare industry. The main problem in  rural areas is  limited  internet connectivity  and slow internet  services.  People  in  rural  areas  don’t  have sufficient knowledge about using a healthcare application on their smartphone.
## BENIFITS OF AI ENABLED HEALTHCARE CHATBOT:
In today’s technology-driven world, every industry is leveraging the power of AI, and the medical industry is no different. Chatbots for healthcare can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, so healthcare experts can focus on complex ones. Below we cover a few common benefits of chatbots for healthcare. 
•	Chatbots help patients get immediate responses, improving patient engagement, providing better care, and reducing wait time. 
•	AI-enabled healthcare chatbot understands patient behavior to deliver personalized recommendations in real-time. 
•	Delegating repetitive tasks to medical chatbots can help organizations reduce the need for human resources. 
•	Patients with minor medical issues can chat with the bot to get simpler medical advice based on their medical history.

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

AI chatbots (aka conversational AI chatbots) are similar to chatbots, but only a more advanced version powered by artificial intelligence. Most AI chatbots today come with Natural Language Processing support which helps them understand the context, solve queries better and learn while doing all this.

You should already have an understanding by now! But here’s a more clear explanation. Consider John, a user visiting a website looking for some information. The AI chatbot pops up on the right side corner of the screen and welcomes.

Now, John types his query on the space provided. The AI chatbot on receiving the query starts analysing what it is. Based on the previous set of data and questions it has already received, the AI chatbot makes a call on what to respond to John’s query. The answer is usually what the AI chatbot thinks is right based on its previous learning. With the combination of natural language processing & artificial intelligence, AI chatbots can seamlessly answer customer queries over a period of time.

Like we said earlier, AI chatbots learn continuously to get better at what they do! So, that’s how AI chatbots work!

Chatbots can provide personalized health information to patients, helping them understand their conditions, medications, and treatment plans. They can offer ongoing support, reminders for medication, and lifestyle recommendations to encourage healthy habits. Chatbots can help users assess their symptoms and provide initial guidance on whether they should seek medical attention, self-manage at home, or consult with a healthcare professional. 

AI chatbots can assist in monitoring patients with chronic conditions by collecting and analyzing relevant health data, providing insights to both patients and healthcare providers. In emergency situations, AI chatbots can assist in providing immediate first aid guidance, helping users take appropriate actions while waiting for professional medical assistance. The successful implementation of AI-enabled healthcare chatbots requires collaboration between technology developers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies to ensure ethical and secure use of these tools in the healthcare ecosystem.
